Tiles
======

If we're using OSM data, we should probably be hosting our own tiles
for forest park. Better to host our own stuff than to rely on outside
services when most of our maps show the same regions. 

For a pretty generous coverage of FP and immediately surrounding roads,
we need about 350MB:
  
  python countTiles.py "12, 18, -122.8374, 45.5097, -122.6833, 45.6246"
    Geographic area:
      -122.837400	left most Longitude (minLong)
      45.509700	bottom most Latitude (minLat)
      -122.683300	right most Longitude (maxLong)
      45.624600	top most Latitude (maxLat)
    Zoom coverage:
      12	least detailed zoom
      18	most detailed zoom
    Total tiles:
      18274
    Total size (at an average of 20KB per tile):
      0.35 GB

    SETUP cost: $0.23
    (One time cost: $0.04 storage, $0.18 posting)
    (Note: If there is a data update, apply this setup cost again.)

    MONTHLY viewing costs:
         10000 visits: $6.46,	with cloudfront: $12.92
        250000 visits: $164.32,	with cloudfront: $328.64
       1000000 visits: $657.64,	with cloudfront: $1315.29
      10000000 visits: $6577.52,	with cloudfront: $13155.03

    (Assumption: Each map visitor will request 200 tiles (load map, pan pan pan pan pan)
    (Note: CloudFront is a distributed content delivery network that makes viewing your tiles faster...
      Amazon charges once for getting it out of the S3 bucket and into CF again for the CF view...
      If all the views are in the same spot, 1/2 the CF cost listed here. If viewing many random
      places,this value.)
